To speed up your system, you can use the following techniques:
1. Caching

    Frontend Caching: Use SWR (stale-while-revalidate) or React Query to cache API responses.
    Backend Caching:
        Use Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data.
        Implement in-memory caching in Golang using sync.Map or groupcache.
    Database Caching: Use MySQL query caching or materialized views.

2. Batch Processing

    Queue Systems: Use Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Google Pub/Sub to process tasks in batches.
    Bulk Inserts & Updates: Instead of single inserts, use MySQLâ€™s INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...), (...) for batch inserts.
    Golang Workers: Use worker pools to process tasks efficiently.

3. Multi-threading & Parallelism

    Goroutines: Run multiple tasks concurrently in Golang using goroutines.
    Database Connection Pooling: Use sql.DB with connection pooling (gorm or database/sql with maxOpenConns tuning).
    Sharding & Partitioning: Split large MySQL tables into smaller partitions for faster queries.

4. API Optimization

    GraphQL or gRPC: Reduce API calls by fetching only required data.
    Compression: Use gzip or Brotli compression for API responses.
    Pagination & Indexing: Optimize queries with proper indexing and implement pagination.
